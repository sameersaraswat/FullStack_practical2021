    <p style="color: white;">Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). All thanks to Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.Faster and Easier Web Development.

        <p style="color: white;">Bootstrap was developed and announced in August 2011 by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton while working at Twitter. The purpose of the development was to make interface development and maintenance very easy and consistent. Bootstrap was not only a framework but a way to make some common design patterns a standard in web design and development. In the beginning, the project was called Twitter Blueprint, but later on, it was renamed Bootstrap and released as an open-source project. The project is still maintained by the same people, as well as a large community of contributors in Github.</p>
